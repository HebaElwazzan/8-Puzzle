8-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile
missing. The purpose of the game is to find a way to order the tiles in numerical order.

This program solves the 8-puzzle game using 3 algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A* search, using
two heuristics, Manhattan, and Euclid. It then displays the search result, if it exists, using a gui 3x3 board.
